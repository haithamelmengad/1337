# Formatted using autopep8 with aggressive level 1

# Input: quantity of bags N, number of turns T
# Output: minimum # of friends needed to search N bags in T turns
# Strategy: instead of computing the # of friends from the given input
# we use the known constraints to approach this as an optimization problem
# Constraints: N <= 10**6 ; T <= 10

# There are two important observations to make from which the solution stems:

# First, a given amount of friends can test âˆ‘ n!/k!(n-k)! for k in [0,n]
# bags in the last turn. We will call this formula E(n)
# Concretely, a group of friends can test more bags by creating entities
# with subsets of the group, growing the amount of testable bags exponentially

# Second, we can maximize the amount of bags tested in early turns by knowing
# The number of turns ahead of time. We can give each entity/subset pills from
# multiple bags, as long as the total amount of bags tested is testable by
# E(total entities - entities)

# Code: I used two ways to solve this problem
# The recursive solution makes the most logical sense and was derived by
# induction, while the iterative solution was derived by recognizing a pattern
# I used dynamic programming to optimize recursion with cache


# Both are available below
